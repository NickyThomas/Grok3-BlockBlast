# Block Blast

**Block Blast** is a colorful, fast-paced puzzle game built with HTML5 and JavaScript. Shoot colored balls to match and clear clusters in a dynamic, ever-growing grid set against a twinkling starfield. Test your aim and strategy as new rows descend every 15 seconds, pushing you closer to the edge of defeat—or victory!

## Objective

The goal of *Block Blast* is to clear all the balls from the grid before they reach the bottom of the screen:
- **Win**: Pop all the balls by forming clusters of 3 or more of the same color. Detached clusters pop automatically, adding to your score!
- **Lose**: If any ball reaches the bottom row, it’s game over. Press the spacebar to start again and try for a higher score.

## Gameplay Features

- **Shooting**: Fire balls that bounce off walls and the top, attaching to the side of existing balls.
- **Combos**: Match 3+ balls of the same color to pop them with a bubble-like burst effect.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: A new row of balls drops from the top every 15 seconds, nudging existing rows downward.
- **Scoring**: Earn 10 points per ball popped, whether from combos or detached clusters.
- **Visuals**: 3D-shaded balls with a subtle gradient and a starry background enhance the experience.
- **Timer**: A "Next Drop" countdown keeps you on your toes.

## Controls

- **Mouse Move**: Aim the shooter by moving the mouse. A small arrow pointer shows your direction.
- **Left Click**: Fire the current ball toward the grid.
- **Spacebar**: Restart the game after a "Game Over" (when balls reach the bottom).
